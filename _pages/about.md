We will continue to update this page as the date for the workshop approaches, however some initial information is available here.

## Meeting structure

This three day workshop/meeting on speciation genomics will combine talks from invited speakers and participants, a discussion panel and a hands-on workshop to learn how to use a composite likelihood approach to infer selection, gene flow and demography from genome scan data.

## Location and dates

The meeting will take place between the **17th-19th June 2019** at the [Marine Biology Laboratory, Tjärnö, Sweden](https://loven.gu.se/english/about_the_loven_centre/tjarno).

To reach Tjärnö, it is easiest to fly either to Oslo or Gothenburg airports. Trains and buses to Strömstad, the nearest town to Tjärnö, run from [Gothenburg centre and Oslo Station](https://www.vastsverige.com/en/stromstad/articles/train--bus/). A local bus is available for departures to Tjärnö itself but we will also organise pickup from Strömstad when necessary.

## Requirements

To attend the meeting, you will need to bring your own laptop and have a basic level of experience in unix and python. We recommend a [software carpentry course](https://software-carpentry.org/) and online resources such as [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

## Costs and registration

There is space for approximately 40-50 participants. To apply, please register [here](/register/). The deadline for applications is **25th February**. It is free to register but attendance will cost $300 (US) to cover accommodation and food for the three days. Travel bursaries are available for MSc and PhD students wishing to attend.
